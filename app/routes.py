You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet\'s resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.','link':'https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/','image':'../static/photos/factorio_pic.jpg'},{'title':'The Henry Stickmin Collection', 'description':'The Henry Stickmin Collection is a Newgrounds choose-your-own-path classic, reborn and revitalized. This 6-game epic culminates in multiple entirely canon, extremely different endings. Each step of the journey has you choose from options such as a Teleporter or calling in your buddy Charles to help you out. Correct choices will move the story forward, but incorrect choices lead to a fail. If you get to the end on your first try, you\'re doing it wrong. Failing is half the fun.','link':'https://store.steampowered.com/app/1089980/The_Henry_Stickmin_Collection/','image':'../static/photos/stickmin_pic.jpg'}]
